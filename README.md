# Instrumental Tools

A collection of scripts useful for monitoring servers and services with Instrumental ([www.instrumentalapp.com](http://www.instrumentalapp.com/)).

## instrumental

Provide data to Instrumental over STDIN.

Basic usage:

```sh
input | INSTRUMENTAL_TOKEN=<API_KEY> instrumental'
```

Input metrics should be provided one per line and in the following format:

`<metric name> <value> [UNIX timestamp]`

When a timestamp is not provided, the metric is recorded at the time received. So, simple <metric name> <value> pairs should be sufficient for the majority of cases.

Note that this script uses .gauge calls exclusively (see the [Instrumental agent documentation](https://github.com/fastestforward/instrumental_agent) for an explanation of call types).

## instrument_server

Monitor server activity by collecting information on CPU and memory usage, disk IO, filesystem usage, etc.

Basic usage:

```sh
instrument_server -k <API_KEY>
```

The API key can also be provided by setting the INSTRUMENTAL_TOKEN environment variable, which eliminates the need to supply the key via command line option.

By default, instrument_server will use the hostname of the current host when reporting metrics, e.g. 'hostname.cpu.in_use'. To specify a different hostname:

```sh
instrument_server -k <API_KEY> -H <HOSTNAME>
```

### Running as a Daemon

To start instrument_server as a daemon:

```
instrument_server -k <API_KEY> -d
```

While the -d flag alone is sufficient for starting instrument_server as a daemon, use of additional parameters allows interaction with the running daemon process:

* start, stop, restart - run, halt, or restart the daemon
* status - display daemon status (running, stopped)
* clean - remove any files created by the daemon
* kill - forcibly halt the daemon and remove its pid file


### Capistrano Integration

Add `require "instrumental_tools/capistrano"` to your capistrano
configuration and instrument_server will be restarted after your
deploy is finished. Additionally, you will need to add a new variable
to your capistrano file.

```ruby
set :instrumental_key, "API_KEY"
```

The following configuration will be added:

```ruby
after "deploy", "instrumental:restart_instrument_server"
after "deploy:migrations", "instrumental:restart_instrument_server"
```

By default, this will attempt to restart the instrument_server command
on all the servers specified in your configuration. If you need to
limit the servers on which you restart the server, you can do
something like this in your capistrano configuration:

```ruby
namespaces[:instrumental].tasks[:restart_instrument_server].options[:roles] = [:web, :worker]
```

### NOTEs

Mac OS users: Due to a bug in Ruby, instrument_server can occasionally deadlock ([bug report](http://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/5811)).

## gitstrumental

Collect commit counts from git repositories:

```sh
cd project_directory
gitstrumental <API_KEY>
```
